google-api-libs
===============

Set of libraries required to test and develop Apps on top of the Google App Engine and using Google API

What we will need
=================

For Development
---------------

 * Eclipse(Most supported IDE)
 * Google Plugin for Eclipse
   * Google Web Toolkit SDK
   * App Engine SDK
 * Ant

Setup
=====

We assume you have eclipse(latest) installed with JDK7+ and ant(apache-ant)

The best approach found so far was to install the google plugin for eclipse. This plugin will automatically download and configure the GWT and AppEngine SDK.
