Testing App Engine Localy
=========================

Now that the SDKs are installed, Java is configured and Eclipse has the plugins, we should be able to do all the next steps from withing eclipse

Sample Project
==============

 * File -> New -> Project....
 * Loook for Google and expand it and choose 'Web Application Project' 
 * Choose a 'Project Name' and Package
 * The other options should be good for a sample project, make sure 'Generate Project Sample Code' is checked
 * Click Finish and now the project will be created with some sample code
 * Now go to the project, open the menu and look for 'Run As' -> 'Web Application'

The application will be deployed locally, this may take some time. You can now follow the process on the Console window. On the 'Development Mode' window will 
appear a link when the deployment is ready, you can go to the URL and see something. If you see something, then the application is working fine, you might need 
to install a plugin but this is not required at this moment.
